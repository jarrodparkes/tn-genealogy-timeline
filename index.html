				<h2>1783-1895 Tennessee, Early Tax List Records</h2>
				<p>This database contains early tax lists from 71 of the 95 counties in Tennessee. Tennessee law did not require that tax lists be kept permanently, so many of the early records have been destroyed. In 1836 many counties sent a copy of their tax lists to the state Treasurer, and most of those have been preserved in the State Library and Archives. The database contains many tax lists for some counties, and just one or two tax lists for others. </P>

Berry (known as the "the oldest printer in Nashville”). Addressing the people of Lincoln County in the Observer’s inaugural issue, Berry declared the paper to be “unchanged, and unchangeable Democrat; and [maintained] that we shall, in our humble way, continue to advocate the Union of these federated States, just so long as forbearance continues to be a virtue – and no longer.”</p>

				<p>Birth certificates were not required by law in Tennessee until 1908. However, the state began to issue delayed birth certificates starting in 1935 after birth certificates were required to register for the newly created Social Security program. Delayed birth certificates provided documentation for those born before the state law took effect or who didn’t have a birth certificate for some other reason. Delayed birth certificates were issued only to people who applied for them; they were not given automatically. People applying for a delayed birth certificate were required to supply supporting documents that proved their birth information.</p>

				<h2>1875-1922 The Tennessean</h2>
				<p>The Tennessean, Nashville's primary daily newspaper, traces its roots back to the Nashville Whig, a weekly paper that began publication on September 1, 1812. The paper underwent various mergers and acquisitions throughout the 19th century, emerging as the Nashville American. The first issue of the Nashville Tennessean was printed on Sunday May 12, 1907. The paper was founded by Col. Luke Lea, a 28-year-old attorney and local political activist. In 1910, the publishers purchased a controlling interest in the Nashville American. They began publishing an edition known as The Tennessean American. When the American formally folded in 1911, some of its employees banded together to found the Nashville Democrat. This paper was purchased by the Tennessean in 1913.</p>

				<h2>1880 United States Federal Census</h2>
				<p>The 1880 census is a valuable tool in part because it is the only U. S. census available for the last two decades of the 1800s. Most of the original 1890 population schedules were destroyed in a fire at the Commerce Department in 1921. Less than one percent of the schedules—records enumerating only 6,160 individuals—survived.

				Many of these questions, specifically those detailing mental and physical health, can only be found within the original census document. Ancestry.com's image viewer allows you to scan the original document for this valuable data. The age of this data may lead to discoveries about fourth, fifth or even sixth ancestral generations. The depth of this data can offer personal detail lacking in earlier census surveys. The family relationships category can provide information about extended family. If a married daughter has been counted as part of her father's household, her married surname will appear in the census. Questions about health may reveal symptoms of family illnesses that have appeared in later generations.</p>

				<h2>1891 Tennessee, Enumeration of Male Voters</h2>
				<p>This state enumeration of eligible voters in Tennessee was ordered by the state’s general assembly in January 1891. The governor was to appoint commissioners in each county to take a census of all males who were age 21 or older in their resident counties as of 1 January 1891. The timing makes these records useful for filling in the gap caused by the loss of the 1890 U.S. Federal Census.</p>

				<h2>1900 United States Federal Census</h2>
				<p>Enumerators of the 1900 census were instructed to record the names of every person in the household. Enumerators were asked to include the following categories in the census: name; address; relationship to the head of household; color or race; sex; month and year of birth; age at last birthday; marital status; number of years married; the total number of children born of the mother; the number of those children living; places of birth of each individual and the parents of each individual; if the individual was foreign born, the year of immigration and the number of years in the United States; the citizenship status of foreign-born individuals over age twenty-one; occupation; whether the person could read, write, and speak English; whether the home was owned or rented; whether the home was on a farm; and whether the home was mortgaged. The categories allowed Congress to determine persons residing in the United States for collection of taxes and the appropriation of seats in the House of Representatives.</p>

				<h2>Tennessee Death Records, 1908-1958</h2>
				<p>This database contains death certificates, as well as indexes to those certificates for the state of Tennessee from 1908 to 1958. Additional information, such as occupation, cause of death, and date and place of burial, may be available on the original record and can be obtained by viewing the image. The name of the informant providing this information is also given, and may be useful in evaluating the reliability of the data. Note that the forms used for reporting deaths 1908-1912 contain far less information than those used from 1914 forward. No death records were recorded by the State of Tennessee in 1913 due to a change in the state law requiring vital records registration.</p>

				<h2>1935-2014 U.S., Social Security Death Index</h2>
				<p>The Death Master File (DMF) from the Social Security Administration (SSA) currently contains over 94 million records. The file is created from internal SSA records of deceased persons possessing social security numbers and whose deaths were reported to the SSA. Often this was done in connection with filing for death benefits by a family member, an attorney, a mortuary, etc. Each update of the DMF includes corrections to old data as well as additional names. [NOTE: If someone is missing from the list, it may be that the benefit was never requested, an error was made on the form requesting the benefit, or an error was made when entering the information into the SSDI.] Beginning in 2014, legislative rules governing the SSDI changed. Going forward, records from the most recent 3 year period will not be available to Ancestry.com. Once a record is older than 3 years (1095 days), it can be published.</p>
