				<h2>1880 United States Federal Census</h2>
				<p>The 1880 census is a valuable tool in part because it is the only U. S. census available for the last two decades of the 1800s. Most of the original 1890 population schedules were destroyed in a fire at the Commerce Department in 1921. Less than one percent of the schedules—records enumerating only 6,160 individuals—survived.

				Many of these questions, specifically those detailing mental and physical health, can only be found within the original census document. Ancestry.com's image viewer allows you to scan the original document for this valuable data. The age of this data may lead to discoveries about fourth, fifth or even sixth ancestral generations. The depth of this data can offer personal detail lacking in earlier census surveys. The family relationships category can provide information about extended family. If a married daughter has been counted as part of her father's household, her married surname will appear in the census. Questions about health may reveal symptoms of family illnesses that have appeared in later generations.</p>
